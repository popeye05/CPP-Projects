Sudoku Solver is a famous leetcode Hard problem.
The solution involves recursion and backtracking. During Learning the solution, one thing came to my mind what if I create the testcases to individually have my Sudoku oslver program, and there comes the idea of Sudoku Puzzle generator,
i Initially got the idea, i.e it will be just the solver program instead it will solve empty, but then i realised that it actually is much trickier and difficult, but ultimately when i learned it was so fun , of course i took help of GPT, but i learned 
and went through the entire process..
